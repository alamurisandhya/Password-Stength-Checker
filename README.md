# 🔑 Password Strength Checker

A beginner-friendly cybersecurity project written in **Python**.
This program helps users test the strength of their passwords based on common security rules.



## 📖 Overview

With cyber-attacks and data breaches increasing every year, using a **strong password** is the first step in protecting your accounts.
This tool checks if a password is:

* Long enough
* Has uppercase and lowercase characters
* Includes numbers
* Contains special symbols

It’s a simple script but demonstrates **core security concepts** like validation and regular expressions.



## ✨ Features

* ✅ Checks password strength in real time.
* ✅ Gives feedback: Weak ❌, Moderate ⚠️, Strong ✅, Very Strong 💪.
* ✅ Uses Python’s built-in `re` module (Regular Expressions).
* ✅ Beginner-friendly and well documented.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** `re` (Regex for pattern matching)
* **Platform:** Runs on any OS (Windows, macOS, Linux) with Python installed.



## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Python (3.6 or above).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open terminal/command prompt and run:
